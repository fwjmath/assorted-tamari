`\\nu`-Tamari lattices

This module implements `\\nu`-Tamari lattices, which are lattices on directed
paths indexed by an arbitrary directed path `\\nu`. They were introduced under
the name of _generalized Tamari lattice_ in [PRV2017]_, in which it was proved
that these lattices are isomorphic to certain intervals in the Tamari lattice.
While it is possible to extract the poset structure directly from
:meth:`TamariLattice`, a more efficient implementation is provided here.
